# Security Policy

## Supported Versions ✅

Only the greatest published version (according to SemVer) will be supported.
This version will be indicated as the [Latest Release on GitHub][latest-release]. :octocat:

Workflows may be pinned to a major version (`@vN`) to receive minor and patch updates;
though it is instead recommended to pin to a specific git-sha and use [Dependabot][] to keep versions updated.

## Reporting a Vulnerability ⚠️

Use GitHub's [built-in reporting mechanism][gh-security] for disclosure.
